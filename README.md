# Awesome WebAssembly Languages ![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)
WebAssembly, or wasm for short, is a low-level bytecode format that runs in the browser just like JavaScript.
It is designed to be faster to parse than JavaScript, as well as faster to execute which makes it a suitable compilation target for new and existing languages.

This repo contains a list of languages that currently compile to or have their VMs in WebAssembly(wasm)  :octocat:

> TurboScript is an experimental programming language for parallel programming for web which compiles to JavaScript (asm.js) and WebAssembly (targeting post-MVP). The syntax is similar to TypeScript and the compiler is open source and written in TypeScript. TurboScript has zero dependencies.

### <a name="walt"></a>WAlt <sup>[top⇈](#contents)</sup>
> WAlt is an alternative syntax for WebAssembly text format. It's an experiment for using JavaScript syntax to write to as 'close to the metal' as possible. It's JavaScript with rules. .walt files compile directly to WebAssembly binary format.
